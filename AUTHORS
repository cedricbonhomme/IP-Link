IP-Link is a free software written and maintained by
Jérôme Hussenet and Cédric Bonhomme.

This project is born in the context of a security course
centered on Honeypot technologies (http://www.foo.be/cours/dess-20082009/).
Thanks to Alexandre Dulaunoy for this course. In particular the discovery of
Circos, courses about Berkeley Packet Filter, tcpdump, etc.
